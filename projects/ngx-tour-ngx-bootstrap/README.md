# Ngx-Tour Ngx-Bootstrap

This is a fork of https://github.com/isaacplmann/ngx-tour that adds support for Angular 9+.

Check out the [documentation/demo page](https://isaacplmann.github.io/ngx-tour).

This is a product tour library built with Angular (2+).  It's inspired by [angular-ui-tour](http://benmarch.github.io/angular-ui-tour).
