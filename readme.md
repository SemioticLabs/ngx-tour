# Ng2 Tour

This is a fork of https://github.com/isaacplmann/ngx-tour that adds support for Angular 9+ for `ngx-tour-ngx-bootstrap`.

Check out the [documentation/demo page](https://isaacplmann.github.io/ngx-tour).

This is a product tour library built with Angular. It's inspired by [angular-ui-tour](http://benmarch.github.io/angular-ui-tour).
